# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle 
# https://www.kaggle.com/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv
# Then, I created a table and inserted the data from the link above.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# Create Spotifydata table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
    track_name varchar NOT NULL,
    track_id varchar NOT NULL,
    popularity integer NOT NULL,
    danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    key integer NOT NULL,
    loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
    mode integer NOT NULL,
    speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
    acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
    instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
    liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
    valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
    duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
    time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

# Analytics

# Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT
    artist_name,
    AVG(popularity) popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What are the top 25 longest songs in the dataset? (calculate duration from ms to seconds)
SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name,
    (duration_ms / 1000) duration_seconds
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC
LIMIT 25;

# What songs give the most calming energy?
SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy < 0.5
ORDER BY energy ASC;

# What are the max and minimum valence? (scored between 0-10)
# (valence measures whether a song will make a person feel happy (high) or sad (low))
SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name,
    ROUND((valence * 10), 2) valence
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE valence = (SELECT MAX(valence) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata)
OR valence = (SELECT MIN(valence) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);
